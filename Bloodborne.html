        <h2 class="game-title">Bloodborne</h2>
        <p class="game-summary">Bloodborne is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Released in 2015 exclusively for the PlayStation 4, it quickly garnered critical acclaim for its atmospheric world, challenging gameplay, and intricate lore.</p>
        <p class="game-summary">Set in the Gothic city of Yharnam, a place plagued by a mysterious illness that turns its inhabitants into grotesque monsters, Bloodborne plunges players into a nightmarish journey filled with danger and intrigue. As a hunter tasked with unraveling the secrets of Yharnam and putting an end to the spreading scourge, players must navigate treacherous streets, ancient tombs, and twisted nightmares in search of answers.</p>
        <p class="game-summary">One of the defining features of Bloodborne is its fast-paced and punishing combat system. Unlike FromSoftware's previous Souls series, which emphasized defensive play and methodical combat, Bloodborne encourages aggression and quick reflexes. Players wield a variety of melee weapons, ranging from swords and axes to firearms and improvised weapons, each with its own unique moveset and playstyle. Combat is frenetic and visceral, requiring players to carefully time their attacks, dodges, and parries to overcome powerful enemies and bosses.</p>
        <p class="game-summary">In addition to its challenging combat, Bloodborne is renowned for its rich and immersive world-building. From the decaying streets of Yharnam to the eldritch horrors lurking in the depths of the city, every corner of the game world is dripping with atmosphere and detail. The game's intricate lore is revealed through environmental storytelling, cryptic item descriptions, and enigmatic characters, inviting players to piece together the mysteries of Yharnam and its dark history.</p>
        <p class="game-summary">Visually, Bloodborne is a stunning achievement, with its hauntingly beautiful art direction and meticulous attention to detail. From the eerie glow of street lamps to the grotesque deformities of the game's monstrous inhabitants, every aspect of the game's visuals contributes to its oppressive and immersive atmosphere. The game's dynamic lighting and particle effects further enhance the sense of dread and tension, creating a truly unforgettable gaming experience.</p>
        <p class="game-summary">Overall, Bloodborne is a masterpiece of game design and storytelling, offering players a challenging and immersive journey through a world of darkness and despair. With its punishing combat, atmospheric world, and deep lore, it stands as one of the defining titles of the PlayStation 4 era, captivating players with its haunting beauty and relentless challenge.</p>
