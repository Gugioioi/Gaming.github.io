        <h2 class="game-title">GOD OF WAR 4</h2>
        <p class="game-summary">God of War (2018), often referred to as God of War 4, is a monumental action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Serving as a soft reboot of the beloved franchise, this installment redefines the series with a fresh setting, narrative direction, and gameplay mechanics while still paying homage to its predecessors.</p>
        <p class="game-summary">The game follows the journey of Kratos, the former Greek god of war, as he navigates the harsh and unforgiving world of Norse mythology alongside his young son, Atreus. Set in the breathtaking realms of Midgard and beyond, Kratos and Atreus embark on an epic quest to fulfill the final wishes of Kratos' deceased wife and Atreus' mother, scattering her ashes from the highest peak in the realms.</p>
        <p class="game-summary">One of the most remarkable aspects of God of War is its deeply emotional and character-driven narrative. Kratos, now older and more contemplative, struggles to come to terms with his violent past and his role as a father, while Atreus grapples with the weight of his destiny and the secrets of his lineage. The bond between father and son is at the heart of the story, providing a poignant and compelling emotional anchor amidst the epic battles and mythical encounters.</p>
        <p class="game-summary">In terms of gameplay, God of War introduces a host of new features and mechanics that breathe new life into the franchise. The game adopts a third-person, over-the-shoulder camera perspective, a departure from the fixed camera angles of previous entries, allowing for more immersive and dynamic combat encounters. Combat itself is deeper and more strategic, with an emphasis on timing, positioning, and utilizing Kratos' iconic Leviathan Axe and bare fists in combination with Atreus' ranged attacks.</p>
        <p class="game-summary">Beyond combat, God of War offers a rich and expansive world to explore, filled with breathtaking vistas, hidden secrets, and challenging puzzles. From the towering peaks of the mountainous regions to the dark and foreboding depths of mythical realms, every corner of Midgard is teeming with lore, mythology, and stunning visual detail.</p>
        <p class="game-summary">Visually, God of War is a technical marvel, showcasing the full power of the PlayStation 4 hardware with its stunning graphics, lifelike character animations, and immersive environments. The game's art direction and design draw inspiration from Norse mythology, resulting in a world that feels both ancient and otherworldly, with each realm offering its own distinct visual identity and atmosphere.</p>
        <p class="game-summary">Overall, God of War (2018) is a triumph of game design and storytelling, seamlessly blending breathtaking visuals, immersive gameplay, and emotional depth to create an unforgettable gaming experience. With its epic scope, compelling characters, and rich mythology, it stands as a true masterpiece of the medium, captivating players and critics alike with its grandeur and ambition.</p>
